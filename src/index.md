I am a computer science PhD student, advised by [Ben Glocker](http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/bglocker/) at Imperial College London and supported by a Microsoft Research scholarship. I am currently interning at Valence Labs, where I am working with [Cian Eastwood](https://cianeastwood.github.io) and [Jason Hartford](https://jhartford.github.io).

During my PhD, I worked on understanding why machine learning methods fail when deployed in the real world. This work centered on the topics of causality, distribution shift, and fairness. During this time, I [led and contributed to projects published](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4PLajkUAAAAJ&hl) in ICLR, ICML, ICCV, MICCAI, Nature Medicine, and more. My research was awarded first place in the 2025 [G-Research PhD prize](https://www.gresearch.com/news/g-research-2025-phd-prize-winners-imperial-college-london/).

Nowadays, I am interested in getting applied machine learning systems working at scale. During my time at Valence, I have been training large generative models of biology as part of their virtual cells program. I can't wait to share what we've been working on!

**I'll be on the job market from Autumn 2025, so feel free to reach out if you have any interesting opportunities.**
