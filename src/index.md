Hi!

I am a Computer Science (machine learning) PhD student, advised by Ben Glocker at Imperial College London. My research focuses on **Causal Deep Learning for Fair and Robust Medical AI**. I am interested in all things involving deep learning, causal inference/discovery, and how we can combine these fields to solve problems in medical imaging and the wider AI community.

I occasionally write blog posts about side projects and things I've learned along my programming journey. If you're interested in discussing anything from this blog, consider reaching out. You can also create an issue on this website's GitHub repo.
