Hi!

<img align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" src="src/assets/CJ-photo.jpg">
I am a computer science PhD student, advised by [Ben Glocker](http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/bglocker/) at Imperial College London. I am currently interning at Valence Labs, where I am working with [Cian Eastwood](https://cianeastwood.github.io) and [Jason Hartford](https://jhartford.github.io).

My research focuses on **Causal Deep Learning for Imaging**. I am interested in anything involving high-dimensional deep learning, causality, and how we can combine these fields to solve problems in science, medicine, and machine learning.

I occasionally write blog posts about side projects and things I've learned. If you're interested in discussing anything from this blog, consider reaching out (my contact details are in the footer).
